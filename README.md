# CUDA Seam Carving

This project implements **seam carving**, a content-aware image resizing technique, accelerated using NVIDIA CUDA for enhanced performance.

## üöÄ Features

-Content-aware image resizing that preserves important visual content
-GPU acceleration with CUDA for improved processing speed
-Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

## üß† Algorithm Overview
Seam carving works by identifying and removing seams‚Äîpaths of least importance‚Äîeither vertically or horizontally, to reduce image dimensions while maintaining key visual feature.
The process involve:

- 1 Converting the image to grayscal.
- 2 Calculating an energy map using gradient magnitude (e.g., via Sobel filters.
- 3 Identifying the seam with the lowest cumulative energ.
- 4 Adding/Removing the identified seam from the imag.
- 5 Repeating the process until the desired image size is achieve.

By leveraging CUDA, the computation of energy maps and seam identification is parallelized, significantly reducing processing time compared to CPU-only implementation.
